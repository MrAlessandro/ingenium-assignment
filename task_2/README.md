# **The Hiring Manager**

Assuming you are the Hiring Manager responsible for recruiting a full-stack engineer, you have been assigned the task of creating a technical assessment to evaluate the candidate's technical proficiency.

1. What hands-on technical question would you come up with to assess the candidate's technical expertise?
2. Once you are done with the tech question, prepare a possible solution that you would be happy to receive from the candidate.

As a guideline, your technical question and solution need to be well different from the first question and it should cover at least the following 3 topics:

- Code quality, structure, efficiency and testing coverage
- Application scalability and performance
- Communication skills and ability to explain technical concepts clearly

**Deliverables**

1. Question: Write the technical question.
2. Code Implementation: Provide the code that solves the question.
3. Video Explanation: Create a video (under 5 minutes) explaining the question, your code changes and the rationale behind your decisions. Assume a non-technical audience. Note: To create the video, you can use tools like [Loom](https://www.loom.com) or your preferred video recording software.
